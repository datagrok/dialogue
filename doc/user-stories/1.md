# Alice wants to send a message to Bob

Background: Alice and Bob have both used Dialogue to communicate with each other in the past.

## User perspective

Alice composes some text, selects Bob as the recipient, and clicks "send."

Bob's computing devices notice that someone he knows has sent him a message. They notify him according to his preferences.

## Details

- Alice composes some text,
    - Alice creates a Document. Documents facilitate quoting, cross-referencing, deduplication, signatures, and encryption. She creates this document using means similar to what we use to communicate today: Desktop, hand-held, command line, or web-based interfaces to software which helps the user compose and format text, and manage one's contact list. [not necessary for messaging to work]
- ... selects Bob as the recipient,
    - Alice's contact-management software already has a copy of one of Bob's public keys.
