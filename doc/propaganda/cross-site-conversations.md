# Cross-Site Discussions

Have you ever thought:

- "I'm tired of the comments I make disappearing into the void of the Internet."
- "I was winning that argument so he deleted his post and now my words are gone."
- "This Reddit thread is having the same discussion that we just had in our mailing list."
- "I commented somewhere about this subject but I can't remember what site or blog it was on."
- "I really want to discuss this blog post with other people, but the poster has disabled comments."

[Dialogue][] is the answer.

- When you send a comment, Dialogue keeps a copy. You can refer to it, or parts of it, from any other site that uses any compatible implementation of the Dialogue protocol.

- When you participate in conversation, Dialogue clients may automatically cache messages that respond or link to yours. That way if your interloqutor takes their ball and goes home, they don't wipe your work from the Internet.

- Dialogue is a protocol that works across sites and across mediums. Using Dialogue you may reply to a message in an NNTP newsgroup on a Reddit-like comment thread, while referencing other text from e-mail, mailing lists, and instant message conversations.

- You keep a copy of every message you send or post, making it easy to re-host conversations you care about even if other sites delete or lose them.

- A Dialogue Document provides a way for other documents to link to any sub-range of the text it contains. A blog post may elect not to provide a discussion interface built-in, but one may use a Dialogue client to establish a discussion thread for that post that references it just as easily as if they had.
