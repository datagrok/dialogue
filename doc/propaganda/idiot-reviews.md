# Idiot reviews

Do you wish that the opinions of idiots were reversed? 

Often, a person's opinion of the quality of a film, book, or product, will be colored by their lifestyle, world-view, politics, religion, sports team, or education level.

When looking for a good rom-com, you probably don't want to include Biff's opinion, who only enjoys action films. When looking for a challenging math textbook you probably don't want the opinion of a slacker student who never wanted to take the class in the first place.

[Opinions][] is the answer.

The Opinions framework tracks finer-granularity opinions than simply "good" or "bad". With data from the Opinions framework, you can establish that Biff likes none of the same movies you do, so his opinion should have a lower influence on the network's overall opinion than a conneseiur whose tastes match your own.
