# Fake reviews

We have learned that [20% of Yelp reviews are fake](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/20-of-yelp-reviews-are-fake-2013-09-24) but that report goes on to propose that the way to fix the problem is to eliminate anonymity, like Facebook.

Do you wish there were a better way, that preserves anonymity without encouraging bogus reviews from marketers?

Do you wish that you could be sure whether the reviews for some product or service you see online are genuine?

[Opinions][] is the answer.

The Opinions framework establishes a network of trust over your Contacts, and their contacts, and their contacts' contacts. It can calculate the probability that some review online is genuine, or a sockpuppet.

The Opinions framework does not force people to link their identity to their avatar, so people need not be afraid (due to social or legal backlash) to post reviews.
