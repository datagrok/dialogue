# Encryption Everywhere

Are you tired of your communications being casually spied upon?

[Dialogue][] is the answer.

Messages in Dialogue are *always* encrypted. They're invalid if they're not encrypted.

**Q.** But what about messages intended to be readable by the general public?

**A.** They're encrypted, too! But, with a key that everyone knows. Address your message *To: Public*, and everyone will be able to decrypt it.

**Q.** Why would you do a redundant thing like that?

**A.** Because:

- it prevents casual, opportunistic eavesdropping
- it makes mass surveillance and analysis of public speech more computationally expensive
- it normalizes encryption, so the mere use of it cannot be painted as suspicious or subversive
- it prevents implementors of Dialogue clients from being lazy about properly providing strong encryption
- it assures senders that all recipients of Dialogue messages are capable of receiving secure messages
