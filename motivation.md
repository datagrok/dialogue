Facebook and Google+ try to assuage this problem with "real name" policies. Unfortunately, not only do such policies actively harm people, they also simply don't work. TODO: link, examples, evidence

The solution to this is: pseudonymous collaborative reputation and filtering.

Avatar enables pseudonymous identities. Opinions enables fine-grained collaborative reputation for Avatars. Messaging uses the reputation information from Opinions to hide undesirable content.

Essentially, I want an Internet where:

1. anyone may express themselves, even the most toxic, but
2. nobody is forced to hear or see that expression.

**Pseudonymous:** you can invent any name you like or have no name at all. You can invent any number of avatars to represent you online in any number of contexts, none of which need to be connected to your Government-recognized name, or each other.

**Reputation:** Avatars accrue reputation through good behavior, _as determined by you_. It's not a single metric; someone who has a high reputation for programming skill might have a low reputation for respectful discourse.

**Collaborative:** The transitive-weight model used to calculate the network's opinion of an Avatar's reputation will weigh the opinions of people whom you trust higher than those you do not. One untrusted sock-puppet vouching for another will carry no weight.

**Filtering:** Users may elect to completely ignore the existence and writings of any Avatar whose reputation does not meet some threshhold or criteria (defined by the user.) Armies of sock-puppets are useless when they're invisible.

This has the same effect that well-intentioned enforcers of "real name policies" want to achieve, without harming people. Reputation is difficult to accrue: it requires participating in good faith and good behavior with those of high reputation who are willing to interact with those who have no reputation. Reputation is multi-faceted; if you find yourself with a poor reputation among some community, you can find your people elsewhere.
