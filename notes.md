# An introduction to [Datagrok Dialogue][Dialogue]

Consider the following:

## The poor state of conversation on the 'web



Several companies' ham-handed attempts to address these problems have only made things worse (Google Plus real name initiative). Several companies stubbornly ignore the problems (Twitter and harassment).

If I leave a comment on a piece of writing on the 'web, no copy is saved for me. I have no reference to it. I have to rememember to come back every so often to see if there has been a reply or to participate in the discussion.

If the blog might be of interest to others, they don't see my comment unless they visit that particular blog. The blog owner is free to censor my words or disable the ability for anyone to comment altogether.

Blogs use a variety of differing comment systems. Some support threaded conversation, most require their own unique login, many have their own unique text-based faux-markup, all have varying support in different browsers and platforms.

If I write on an independent web-based "forum," the discussion is limited to the members of that particular forum.

A popular social service like Hacker News, Reddit, Facebook, or Digg will reach a larger audience. But these conversations still exist in silos; I can't (without a lot of manual copy-paste and linking) integrate a comment made on Hacker News into an ongoing discussion on Reddit, or some web-based forum. And again, I have no local copy.

If those in power at any of these sites decide they don't like the conversation, it can be gone forever. If Reddit decides to close down their site, all the conversations I've ever had there can disappear forever.

### Jerks rule

There's a lot of jerks cluttering up those sites, too. Each has grown rapidly, and converged on a lowest-common-denominator of opinion that resembles their largest segment of users. If their main segment isn't jerks, it's people who have very little in common with me. I don't like what they like, but there's more of them then there are of me. I lose interest in the content that the site promotes. I leave, and the site resembles them even more.

I could send an e-mail to all my friends, but there's no way to say "e-mail to the general public," and e-mails imply an interruption; an implied "I expect you to read this and take some action."

Let's say we happen across a piece of writing on the Internet, and we want to discuss it with others who have read it.

_If I were writing a research paper about Dialogue, what would the introduction look like? (c.f. the abstract)_

---

_"Dialogue, in an abstract." 200-250 words?_

_Q: Do longer (thesis- or book-length) papers have longer abstracts?_

---

_"Dialogue, in a tweet." Limit: 140 characters, minus a short URL._

_Maybe several buzzfeed-headline-style tweets that highlight a problem dialogue is intended to solve?_

### scratchpad

- When I want to engage in a discussion on the Internet about a particular topic, I might:
    - visit the comments section of a relevant blog post, or
    - visit the discussion area of a relevant Reddit post, or
    - visit a relevant web-based forum, or
    - visit the comments area of a Facebook post, or
    - send an e-mail to a specific group of people about a particular subject, or
    - search for related discussions happening on Twitter and reply to them, or
    - an innumerable number of other web-based services.

- Everybody knows the increasingly popular Internet adage: "don't read the comments."

-  But, attempting to solve this problem introduces a spate of new problems. Dialogue is my attempt to catalog and solve them all.

- The migration of users from Slashdot to Kuro5hin to Digg to Reddit to Hacker News. Meanwhile all non-nerds migrated: MySpace to Facebook and/or Google-plus and/or Twitter. Kids these days seem to be fond of Tumblr, but even tumblr is growing a characteristic flavor.

I love the Internet, but it is terrible.

I think the Internet might be humanity's greatest achievement so far. It is central to most of what it means to be living in an "information age." It is the last bastion of truly free speech and expression in the world. It democratizes us and erodes political and cultural borders.

The Internet has also brought us many unpleasant and vile things: Spam. Revenge porn. Silicon Valley and the displacement of San Francisco families for privileged white nerds. Anonymous harassment, stalking, and bullying. Zuckerberg, Facebook, and Google. Mob mentalities. NSA spying.

The same power that has allowed the weird and marginalized to find and celebrate in each other, has also allowed the nasty and abusive to collaborate.

Those vile things begat others: Real-name policies. DRM. 

### scratchpad

- he (and it is invariably a _he_) who owns the forum has the power
    - douchebags attributing forum popularity for self-merit (example: atwood)
- it wasn't always like this. in the early days, we had USENET. distributed, threaded discussion. no central control.
- now habituated to participate in conversation "at" a website, allowing that site to capture your words, no local copy, no control, no ability to find it again if it drops off the internet, other people can delete your voice

### scratchpad

- i believe in radical free speech and expression, but not until we have good filters
- twitter has been around since 2006 and still ignores harassment, while cracking down on spam
- silicon valley's motto: if there's no business plan, exit, or pivot, it's not worth doing. Contrast to the academic work that created the protocols and internet so far.
- if we're going to fix the internet, it has to be with open protocols. this won't make me rich. anybody can build a client. I suspect this will enable a platform that people can build new businesses upon, but the platform itself must not be corrupted by greed.
